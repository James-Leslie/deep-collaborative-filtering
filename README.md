# Deep Collaborative Filtering

#### 10/01/2019
  - Attempted to create a library of functions to use for recommender datasets.
  - All functions can be found in `interactions_data.py` and `interactions_model.py`.
  - `CLR.py` and `OneCycle.py` are taken from    [this repo](https://github.com/nachiket273/One_Cycle_Policy).

  - added `train_test_*.ipynb` notebooks to wrangle all datasets into consistent format
    - includes encoding user and item IDs sequentially from 0-n
  - TO-DO: add URL for original .dat files to make notebooks reproducible without storing data locally
